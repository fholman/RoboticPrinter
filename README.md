# Development of a Multifunctional Portable Printer Robot

## Overview
This project focuses on the development of a multifunctional portable printer robot designed for lightweight and efficient printing on various surfaces. The printer robot aims to enhance mobility and ease of use, making it suitable for various applications, including educational, artistic, and professional printing tasks.

## Team
- **Sean Glendinning**
- **Fraser Holman**
- **Caelan Mackenzie**
- **Jay Maltman**

## Supervisors
- **Dr. Cheng Wang**
- **Xie Dong**

## University
**Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, United Kingdom**  
**Degree**: Master of Engineering in Robotics, Autonomous and Interactive Systems

## Features
- **Bluetooth Connectivity**: Allows the printer to connect with mobile devices for easy operation.
- **Image Processing**: Takes images, converts them to bitmap format, and preprocesses them (e.g., removes large white spaces, detects grey areas).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A mobile application that allows users to control the printer and manage print jobs.
- **Lightweight Design**: The printer robot is designed to be lightweight, making it portable and easy to use.

## Requirements
- **Hardware**: 
  - Robotic printer chassis
  - HP C6602 print head
  - Motors and wheels for mobility
- **Software**: 
  - Android app (built using Flutter and VSCode)
  - MCU main program (STM32 board using platformIO on VSCode)
